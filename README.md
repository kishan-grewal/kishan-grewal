Hi! I'm Kishan, a second-year **MEng Robotics & AI** student at UCL. I’m passionate about building intelligent robotic systems and love working at the intersection of **software**, **control**, and **hardware** as robotics engineers do.

At the moment, I’m focused on developing with **ROS 2**, working on both real robots and simulations. After my time at MangDang, I plan to explore **reinforcement learning for robotics** to deepen my understanding of autonomy and adaptive behaviour.

I mostly work with:

- 🧠 **Languages:** Python, C++
- 🛠️ **Tools:** ROS 2, Gazebo, RViz, OpenCV
- 🤖 **Interests:** Quadrupeds, embedded control, and AI-driven behaviour
